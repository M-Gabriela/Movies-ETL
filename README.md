# Movies-ETL

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to refactor the code from Module 8 to create one function that takes in the three files: Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data, and perform the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.

## Tools 

- Data Sources: wikipedia-movies.json, movies_metadata.csv, ratings.csv
- Software: Python3, PostgreSQL

## Roadmap

- Create an ETL pipeline from raw data to a SQL database.
- Extract data from disparate sources using Python.
- Clean and transform data using Pandas.
- Use regular expressions to parse data and to transform text into numbers.
- Load data with PostgreSQL.
